This project is a simple Library Management System implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to manage a library collection by adding, removing, and marking books as read or unread. 
The system provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily add new books to their library, view existing books, and update their reading status.
